      <p class="w3-animate-bottom" align="center"><em>"Abdullah is an excellent student, he showed to be very enthusiastic and one of the top students in my two courses. His dissertation work in Interaction demonstrated ample creativity, excellent programming skills, and innovation. His work at the University is of exceptional quality, with abundant originality, and technically outstanding. He showed to be able to work quite well independently and in groups. He also grasped quickly many of the concepts, bringing originality to his work, and his curiosity and enthusiasm have led him beyond the scope of his dissertation and courses. I’m convinced without doubts that he will fulfil, if not exceed your expectations."</em></p>

      <h4><p align="center"><b>Mifra Khan</b> (Product Management at Namshi.com)</p></h4></a>
      <p class="w3-animate-bottom" align="center"><em>"Abdullah is a gifted developer with a sharp sense of GUI and User Experience. I studied with Abdullah at Heriot-Watt University and worked with him on a number of different projects, including a final Software Engineering project that lasted a year. He mainly handled the frontend and UX design part of the Software project, and ensured Agile practices were followed. He has a strong eye for User Experience, knows what the users of a system want to see, and designs the user journey accordingly. Abdullah is a fun and efficient team member who never lets you get bored at work and makes sure all deliverables are completed on time and in the most efficient (and fun) way. I am sure he will be an asset to any team he is a part of."</em></p>

      <h4><p align="center"><b>Noor Abood</b> (Community Manager at ExtraCake P.R.A)</p></h4></a>
      <p class="w3-animate-bottom" align="center"><em>"Abdullah joined the team to manage up to 30 volunteers in the event Main Stage and ESL Arena. During this time, he has proven himself to be a fast learner, reliable and a competent team member. Main Stage is one of the events highly challenged areas, where there is little room for mistakes, and Abdullah managed to perform his role efficiently and successfully. 
      In such a short period, Abdullah was able to understand the tasks at hand, build rapport with staff and volunteers, as well as initiate and execute tasks accordingly. He is a pleasant and friendly individual who is a well-respected and valued member of the team."</em></p>

    <div class="w3-half">
      <h4><p align="center"><b>Aneel Aranha</b> (Senior Project Manager at Informa Middle East)</p></h4></a>
      <p class="w3-animate-bottom" align="center"><em>"He worked as a volunteer supervisor, in charge of coordinating / managing / working alongside 60 other volunteers for a challenging creative festival in Q1 of 2017. Not only did he perform his role exceptionally but also became an essential member of the core team. No task was too small (or as in most cases) too big to be carried out. In addition to his people management abilities, he also displayed his skills in problem solving by offering correct simple solutions to complicated problems and while remaining impressively calm through stress and fatigue. Abdullah has the rare ability to bring an energy and positiveness to the environment he is in. This is apparent in the roles he's been naturally selected for. He is a must have on your team."</em></p>

Abdullah is a great team-player, easy to communicate with, follows instructions quickly and thoroughly but is also great at instructing others. He always keeps his calm and positive energy during stressful situations before and during any event and does his best to help in any way possible. During both Creative Festivals Abdullah organised and managed our volunteer teams, instructed all volunteers and explained them daily tasks, helped tend to attendees at registration and ticketing booths, organised any materials and logistics needed for talks and workshops and was readily available for any additional last-minute tasks. He is trustworthy and an amazing addition to any team and I would recommend him to every company interested with confidence."</em></p>

      <p class="w3-animate-bottom" align="center"><em>"Abdullah was my student in an advance course on rigorous methods for software engineering. He excelled in the course and demonstrated exceptional attention to detail when designing and analysing complex model specifications. Abdullah has intuitive talent of problem solving, which he demonstrated when using his technical skills in various modelling scenarios, e.g. modelling of Automatic Vessel Protection (AVP) system, enterprise models, constraint satisfaction problems. I recommend him most highly!"</em></p>

  <b>I am a very passionate lover of Cyber-Security. I have pursued this passion into my study and I joined Heriot-Watt University in the UK and graduated with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Systems with Honors in 2018. Nevertheless, I still had the passion to learn more and I joined <a href="https://www.stcloudstate.edu/" title="St. Cloud State University Homepage" target="_blank" style="color: #CD1041" class="w3-hover-text-blue">St. Cloud State University</a> in USA, to attain a <a href="https://www.stcloudstate.edu/" title="Information Assurance (M.S.)

I selected this program because it is the only program that is approved by the Department of Homeland Security.</b> <br /><br />

  <b>This focus on getting academic accreditation did not stop me from having extra curriculum activities and I participated in many events either as a competitor or as an event organizer.</b> <br /><br />

  <b>Specialties:<br />
• Developing, pitching and evangelizing vision for security<br />
• Creative team management<br />
• Strong emphasis on design iteration through research-driven testing<br />
• Experience with C#, C++, C, LUA, R, SQL, mySQL, .NET, Python, Java, HTML, CS, JS, PHP, jQuery, and AJAX</b><br /><br />

      <br /><br />
      • <b>Dissertation Project:</b> Focused on the field of Interaction in Video Games (Tech Demo: Beyond Souls): Created a game from scratch using the Unity3D game engine to conduct a systematic analysis on a game’s user interface, included with its overall performance, as well as player’s behaviour in a stressful and eerie virtual environment, using volunteers who are familiar with common video-game controls. The project involves studying, as well as play-testing, different multiplayer games in order to gain a first-hand perspective to hypothesize a core relationship between player and an interaction. Production of a multiplayer game, where users can interact with one another, as well as, the objects that surround them was vital; especially in acquiring the analysis to the aforementioned relationship.</p>

      • <b>Web Programming (Project 1) -</b> Created a music store website "Spectre Music" where customers can add items to cart and checkout. Using HTML5 (XHTML syntax), CCS3, responsive web design, PHP, XML, mySQL and JavaServer Pages (JSP).
      <br /><br />
      • <b>WP (Project 2) -</b> Created a Twitter Follower Manager website, using the Twitter API implementing AJAX and MySQL databases.
      <br /><br />
